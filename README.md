## 👋 About This Repository

Welcome to my **TryHackMe Portfolio** — a living record of my growth in cybersecurity, problem-solving, and human-centered tech support.

I’ve always believed that good technical support isn’t just about finding the right command — it’s about **understanding people**, identifying the root cause, and creating solutions that last. This repo is where I **show my work**, demonstrating not only my technical progression but also my thought process, empathy, and persistence.

Each reflection below walks through what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how those lessons apply to real-world troubleshooting and support.

## 🧰 Tools, Skills & Approach 

- **Security & Analysis:** Nmap, Hydra, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, John the Ripper  
- **Problem-Solving:** Investigative mindset, pattern recognition, user empathy  
- **AI & Automation:** Using tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot for guided exploration, code review, and documentation  
- **Support & Communication:** Writing clear documentation, walking users through troubleshooting with patience and structure

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Good support isn’t just technical — it’s emotional engineering.”

Every log, every ticket, every command prompt is a conversation. I see security and support as two sides of the same practice: understanding systems — and the people who rely on them.

---

## 🧭 Goals

- Continue building a full public **portfolio of completed TryHackMe rooms**  
- Transition into a **technical support or security operations** role where I can combine human empathy with structured troubleshooting  
- Keep learning, documenting, and sharing progress openly
